    abstract = {In big data area a significant challenge about string similarity join is to find all similar pairs more efficiently. In this paper, we propose a parallel processing framework for efficient string similarity join. First, the input is split into some disjoint small subsets according to the joint frequency distribution and the interval distribution of strings. Then the filter-verification strategy is adopted in the computation of string similarity for each subset so that the number of candidate pairs is reduced before an effective pruning strategy is used to improve the performance. Finally, the operation of string join is executed in parallel. Para-Join algorithm based on the multi-threading technique is proposed to implement the framework in a multi-core system while Pada-Join algorithm based on Spark platform is proposed to implement the framework in a cluster system. We prove that Para-Join and Pada-Join cannot only avoid reduplicate computation but also ensure the completeness of the result. Experimental results show that Para-Join can achieve high efficiency and significantly outperform than state-of-the-art approaches, meanwhile, Pada-Join can work on large datasets.},

		 is false and what is unknown can be useful in
		 situations where decisions have to be taken on the
		 basis of scarce information. In order to learn in a
		 three-valued setting, we adopt Extended Logic Programs
		 (ELP) under a Well-Founded Semantics with explicit
		 negation WFSX as the representation formalism for
		 learning. Standard Inductive Logic Programming
		 techniques are then employed to learn the concept and
		 its opposite. The learnt definitions of the positive
		 and negative concepts may overlap. In the paper, we
		 handle the issue of combination of possibly
		 contradictory learnt definitions, and we show
		 strategies for theory refinement",

  Abstract                 = {The management and analysis of large-scale datasets -- described with the term Big Data -- involves the three classic dimensions volume, velocity and variety.
While the former two are well supported by a plethora of software components, the variety dimension is still rather neglected.
We present the BDE platform -- an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use and adaptable (cluster-based and standalone) platform for the execution of big data components and tools like Hadoop, Spark, Flink. 
The BDE platform was designed based upon the requirements gathered from the seven societal challenges put forward by the European Commission in the Horizon 2020 programme and targeted by the BigDataEurope pilots. 
As a result, the BDE platform allows to perform a variety of Big Data flow tasks like message passing (Kafka, Flume), storage (Hive, Cassandra) or publishing (GeoTriples).
In order to facilitate the processing of heterogeneous data, a particular innovation of the platform is the semantic layer, which allows to directly process RDF data and to map and transform arbitrary data into RDF.},

abstract="Hundreds of public SPARQL endpoints have been deployed on the Web, forming a novel decentralised infrastructure for querying billions of structured facts from a variety of sources on a plethora of topics. But is this infrastructure mature enough to support applications? For 427 public SPARQL endpoints registered on the DataHub, we conduct various experiments to test their maturity. Regarding discoverability, we find that only one-third of endpoints make descriptive meta-data available, making it difficult to locate or learn about their content and capabilities. Regarding interoperability, we find patchy support for established SPARQL features like ORDER BY as well as (understandably) for new SPARQL 1.1 features. Regarding efficiency, we show that the performance of endpoints for generic queries can vary by up to 3--4 orders of magnitude. Regarding availability, based on a 27-month long monitoring experiment, we show that only 32.2{\%} of public endpoints can be expected to have (monthly) ``two-nines'' uptimes of 99--100{\%}.",

  Abstract                 = {sparql is the w3c standard query language for querying data expressed in the Resource Description Framework (rdf). The increasing amounts of rdf data available raise a major need and research interest in building efficient and scalable distributed sparql query evaluators. In this context, we propose sparqlgx: our implementation of a distributed rdf datastore based on Apache Spark. sparqlgx is designed to leverage existing Hadoop infrastructures for evaluating sparql queries. sparqlgx relies on a translation of sparql queries into executable Spark code that adopts evaluation strategies according to (1) the storage method used and (2) statistics on data. We show that sparqlgx makes it possible to evaluate sparql queries on billions of triples distributed across multiple nodes, while providing attractive performance figures. We report on experiments which show how sparqlgx compares to related state-of-the-art implementations and we show that our approach scales better than these systems in terms of supported dataset size. With its simple design, sparqlgx represents an interesting alternative in several scenarios.},

abstract="Biomedical data, e.g. from knowledge bases and ontologies, is increasingly made available following open linked data principles, at best as RDF triple data. This is a necessary step towards unified access to biological data sets, but this still requires solutions to query multiple endpoints for their heterogeneous data to eventually retrieve all the meaningful information. Suggested solutions are based on query federation approaches, which require the submission of SPARQL queries to endpoints. Due to the size and complexity of available data, these solutions have to be optimised for efficient retrieval times and for users in life sciences research. Last but not least, over time, the reliability of data resources in terms of access and quality have to be monitored. Our solution (BioFed) federates data over 130 SPARQL endpoints in life sciences and tailors query submission according to the provenance information. BioFed has been evaluated against the state of the art solution FedX and forms an important benchmark for the life science domain.",

 title = {{L}ink {T}raversal {Q}uerying for a {D}iverse {W}eb of {D}ata},
 abstract = {Traditional approaches for querying the Web of Data often involve centralised warehouses that replicate remote data. Conversely, Linked Data principles allow for answering queries live over the Web by dereferencing URIs to traverse remote data sources at runtime. A number of authors have looked at answering SPARQL queries in such a manner; these link-traversal based query execution (LTBQE) approaches for Linked Data offer up-to-date results and decentralised (i.e., client-side) execution, but must operate over incomplete dereferenceable knowledge available in remote documents, thus affecting response times and ``recall'' for query answers. In this paper, we study the recall and effectiveness of LTBQE, in practice, for the Web of Data. Furthermore, to integrate data from diverse sources, we propose lightweight reasoning extensions to help find additional answers. From the state-of-the-art which (1) considers only dereferenceable information and (2) follows rdfs:seeAlso links, we propose extensions to consider (3) owl:sameAs links and reasoning, and (4) lightweight RDFS reasoning. We then estimate the recall of link-traversal query techniques in practice: we analyse a large crawl of the Web of Data (the BTCâ€™11 dataset), looking at the ratio of raw data contained in dereferenceable documents vs. the corpus as a whole and determining how much more raw data our extensions make available for query answering. We then stress-test LTBQE (and our extensions) in real-world settings using the FedBench and DBpedia SPARQL Benchmark frameworks, and propose a novel benchmark called QWalk based on random walks through diverse data. We show that link-traversal query approaches often work well in uncontrolled environments for simple queries, but need to retrieve an unfeasible number of sources for more complex queries. We also show that our reasoning extensions increase recall at the cost of slower execution, often increasing the rate at which results returned; conversely, we show that reasoning aggravates performance issues for complex queries.},

In this paper, we present Atlas, a peer-to-peer system for storing, updating and querying RDF(S) data. The Atlas system has been built using the distributed hash table Bamboo. Atlas was developed in the context of project OntoGrid, where it was used as a distributed repository for RDF(S) metadata describing Grid services and resources. The development of Atlas continues in other projects that our group participates currently. This paper gives an overview of the most recent version of Atlas and discusses a representative application. "

The high data traffic cost and response time significantly affect the performance of distributed SPARQL queries as the number of SPARQL end point and the volume of data at each endpoint increase. In this context, parallelisation is promising to fully exploit the potential of connections to SPARQL endpoints and thus improve the efficiency of querying Linked Data. We propose LHD, a distributed SPARQL engine that is built on a highly parallel infrastructure and able to minimise query response time, and we evaluate its performance using a BSBM based environment.},

abstract = "Abstract The amount of bio-medical data available on the Web grows exponentially with time. The resulting large volume of data makes manual exploration very tedious. Moreover, the velocity at which this data changes and the variety of formats in which bio-medical data is published makes it difficult to access them in an integrated form. Finally, the lack of an integrated vocabulary makes querying this data more difficult. In this paper, we advocate the use of Linked Data to integrate, query and visualize bio-medical data. The resulting Big Linked Data allows discovering knowledge distributed across manifold sources, making it viable for the serendipitous discovery of novel knowledge. We present the concept of Big Linked Data by showing how the constant stream of new bio-medical publications can be integrated with the Linked Cancer Genome Atlas dataset (TCGA) within a virtual integration scenario. We ensure the scalability of our approach through the novel TopFed federated query engine, which we evaluate by comparing the query execution time of our system with that of FedX on Linked TCGA. Then, we show how we can harness the value hidden in the underlying integrated data by making it easier to explore through a user-friendly interface. We evaluate the usability of the interface by using the standard system usability questionnaire as well as a customized questionnaire designed for the users of our system. Our overall result of 77 suggests that our interface is easy to use and can thus lead to novel insights. "

abstract="Link traversal based query execution is a new query execution paradigm for the Web of Data. This approach allows the execution engine to discover potentially relevant data during the query execution and, thus, enables users to tap the full potential of the Web. In earlier work we propose to implement the idea of link traversal based query execution using a synchronous pipeline of iterators. While this idea allows for an easy and efficient implementation, it introduces restrictions that cause less comprehensive result sets. In this paper we address this limitation. We analyze the restrictions and discuss how the evaluation order of a query may affect result set size and query execution costs. To identify a suitable order, we propose a heuristic for our scenario where no a-priory information about relevant data sources is present. We evaluate this heuristic by executing real-world queries over the Web of Data.",

Massive publication efforts of RDF data driven by initiatives like the Linked Open Data movement, and the need to exchange large datasets has unveiled the drawbacks of traditional RDF representations, inspired and designed by a document-centric and human-readableWeb. Among the main problems are high levels of verbosity/redundancy and weak machine-processable capabilities in thedescription of these datasets. This scenario calls for efficient formats for publication and exchange.This article presents a binary RDF representation addressing these issues. Based on a set ofmetrics that characterizes the skewed structure of real-world RDF data, we develop a proposal of an RDF representation thatmodularly partitions and efficiently represents three components of RDF datasets: Header information, a Dictionary, and the actual Triples structure (thus called HDT). Our experimental evaluation shows that datasets in HDT format can be compacted by more than fifteen times as compared to current naive representations, improving both parsing and processing while keeping a consistent publication scheme. Specific compression techniques over HDT further improve these compression rates and prove to outperform existing compression solutions for efficient RDF exchange.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, we observed a steadily increasing amount of RDF datasets made available on the web of data. The decentralized nature of the web, however, makes it hard to identify all these datasets. Even more so, when downloadable data distributions are discovered, only insufficient metadata is available to describe the datasets properly, thus posing barriers on its usefulness and reuse. In this paper, we describe an attempt to exhaustively identify the whole linked open data cloud by harvesting metadata from multiple sources, providing insights about duplicated data and the general quality of the available metadata. This was only possible by using a probabilistic data structure called Bloom filter.
 Finally, we published a dump file containing metadata which can further be used to enrich existent datasets.},
